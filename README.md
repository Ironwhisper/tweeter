# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. But what may look nice and simple on the *--outside*,
may in reality reflect a much deeper **filling**.

## Initializing

Before one can begin using this amazing Twitter clone, several things must be done:

 - Install all dependencies, as listed in the **'Dependencies'** section
 - Start up the server using *'npm start'* or *'npm run local'* commands
 - Look in the mirror and give yourself a thumbs up. You deserve it! :thumbsup: :thumbsup:

## Description

This project provides some very basic Twitter-like functionality

    * Users can input their tweets by clicking *Compose* button and writing their message in a slick slide-out form.
    * Upon clicking **Tweet** their text will show up right below the compose form (which can slide right back up on subsequent Compose click).
    * **Error** messages will slide out right below the Tweet button, notifying user if his message exceeds the 140 character limit, or is *non-existant* at all.
    * Character limit of **140** is counting down remaining characters in *real-time*!
    * User names, handles and avatars for the tweets are randomly selected using ***Chance*** generator.
    * Tweets that already reside within the ***Mongo Database*** are displayed in reverse chronological order, will light up upon mouseover, and can even be liked!
